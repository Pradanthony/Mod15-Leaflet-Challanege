# Mod15-Leaflet-Challanege
Using Leaflet has been very fun activity specially someone who likes Geography.
This challenge was easy and fun.
Data visualization was created for Earthquake data recordings around the world with the use of Leaflet.
The data markers on the map represented the data on each earthquake like size and depth.
